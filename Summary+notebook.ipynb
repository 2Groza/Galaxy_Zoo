    "# Introduction to this project\n",
    "\n",
    "A major advantage of deep learning is that useful features can be learned automatically from images. In Kim & Brunner's previous work, they showed that convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) are able to produce accurate star-galaxy classifications by learning directly from the pixel values of photometric images.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when using supervised learning algorithms, we need a lot of manual tagging data or images, which is pretty time/resource consuming. If we can use a unsupervised learning way to extract useful features automaticly and then run clustering algorithms on those extracted features, we may realize unsupervised star-galaxy classification as well as pixel wise classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Kim's previous work](https://github.com/EdwardJKim/unsupervised-dl4astro/blob/master/notebooks/kmeans.ipynb), he proposed an scheme to train a classifier without any labels: He assigned \"surrogate\" classes, and train the network to discriminate between a set of surrogate classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest problem lies in the number of surrogate classes. If we use N surrogate classes, we need to use N output units in the last layer. This can cause the network to become extremely complex, also can cause overfitting problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I try to use a variational auto-encoders(VAEs, for classification) and auto-encoders(AEs, for segmentation) instead of use surrogate classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the classification task, I hope I can make use of VAEs' dimensionality reduction ability to make clustering easier. And then I can try different clustering algorithms to separate the hidden variables of in the hidden space. However, VAEs are not designed to be a classifier but a generator. In order to get better classification performance, I tried to revise the loss function of VAEs. From both mathematical and practical perspective, VAE with new loss function works better, which means a higher accuracy can be obtained after the cluster step followed by the VAE dim-reduction process.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the segmentation task, I used AEs instead of VAEs, for we don't expect the neural net to be able to generate new images. The only goal of our neural net here is to reproduce the original images with a denoising effect. To obtain better performance, I tried to use residual connections between each down-sampling layer and the correspond up-sampling layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the classification task, the best result I got was higher than 88.9%(accuracy), using a star-galaxy proportioin priori. And an area under curve(AUC) over 0.92 is onbtained if the groundtruth labels are include. I tried supervised learning to make a comparision and that supervised accuracy is about 95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the unsupervised segmentation task, here is a trade-off problem: if we want to obtain a higher sensitivity that we can detect as many objects as possible, including the faint ones, we must lower the neural net's detection threshold. But then some of the noise pixels will also be detected as stars or galaxies. In pursuit of better results, pixel level labeled data must be introduced. Sofie and I will continue to work on this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then combine the two networks above. A network has the ability to perform unsupervised star-galaxy segementation and classification can be obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following picture shows part of the segmentation and classification result. The neural net found 38 of 40 central objects, and the classification accuracy is about 89%.\n",

    "## 1.1 The mathematical principles of AEs/VAEs\n",
    "### 1.1.1 An introduction to AEs and VAEs\n",
    "In Auto-encoder(AE), we map the input images to a low dimensional hidden space, like the V layer in the following figure:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/tensorstone/markdownfigs/blob/master/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E5%BF%AB%E7%85%A7%202017-08-19%2019.08.09.png?raw=true\" width=450 height=450 />\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss function of AE measures the pixel-wise difference between input images and output images. We may call this self-supervised learning. By performing down-sample and upsample process, hot pixels will be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we want to use a given V to generate a image, the result may be bad. Because here the V space is not that continuous/smooth.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem(to generate new samples ), we may use a variational auto-encoder(VAE). VAE is always used as a generative model to generate new samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Encoder part of the VAEs, a certain class of input images are mapped to a certain Multi-dimensional (depends on the number of hidden variables) Gaussian distribution. And then the Decoder use a resampled hidden value to generate a new image.\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/tensorstone/markdownfigs/blob/master/%E5%B1%8F%E5%B9%95%E5%BF%AB%E7%85%A7%202017-08-19%2019.08.40.png?raw=true\" width=450 height=450 />\n",

    "\n",

    "So, the first part of loss function here is also the same: pixel-wise difference between input images and output images.\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for better performance in generation tasks, we hope that the total distribution can also obey a normal distribution. We can use KL-divergence to describe the difference between two distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D_{KL}(P,Q) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} P(x) \\log \\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}dx$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$P(x)\\sim \\sum_i^m N(\\mu_i,\\sigma_i^2) \\quad Q(x) \\sim N(0,1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization process is quite like using stochastic gradient descent: everytime we only use a batch of samples to calculate the P(x), so this is a stochastic optimization. In the mean sense, a normal distribution Q can be reached by P.\n",

    "As a matter of fact, the KL-term here act as a regularizer that can restrict V_mean and V_variance. The final result is we can use any point from the Gaussian in this hidden space to generate a quite good image that at least looks like one of input samples of the several classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This N(0,1) priori is good at generating new images, but not conducive to unsupervised classification. To separate different classes into two or more clusters, a better choice of the priori distribution can be a double-peak Gaussian.\n",

    "[Unsupervised learning of phase transitions: from principal component analysis to variational autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02435) introduced an unsupervised learning way to approach phase transitions. The author used PCA, AE and VAE to learn about the latent parameters which best describe states of the two-dimensional Ising model and the three-dimensional XY model. And by using only one hidden variable and compare it to magnetic moment values, the author draw the conclusion that the linear relation between hidden variable and magnetic moment shows that they are the same thing. In other word, the neuralnet learned the order parameter that can best separate different classes(two phases of Ising model).\n",
